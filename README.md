#tpp-map

A map of the countries negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreemment.

I saw this graphic on the Trans-Pacific_Partnership [wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership#Membership_and_accession) and thought "that map should be centered on the Pacific ocean!"

I rebuilt the map with [d3js](http://d3js.org/), this time centered on the Pacific region the article is named for.  Along the way, I combined the list of countries from the original map with the countries shown in the *Members and Potential Members* table.  I also updated the color scale to a qualitative 3-class paired scale from [http://colorbrewer2.org/](http://colorbrewer2.org/).
